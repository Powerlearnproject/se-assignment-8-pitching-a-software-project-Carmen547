 Assignment: Pitching a Software Project
 Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of how to pitch a software project. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Understanding the Audience:
   - Why is it important to understand your audience when pitching a software project? How can you tailor your pitch to different types of stakeholders (e.g., investors, technical team, customers)?
When pitching a software project, it is important to consider the audience so that you can effectively explain and demonstrate the value of your proposed solution. By doing so, you will best help your audience understand what is at stake and give them an accurate impression of what is possible.
1. Evaluate the Investors:
Investors are primarily concerned with the financial viability and growth-potential of the project.
What you should speak to investors about is the market opportunity, revenue model, competitive advantage, and not to mention the problem you are solving.
2. Technical Team:
The technical team is mainly concerned with the feasibility, scalability, and maintainability of the software solution.
What you should speak to the technical team about is the technical architecture, the development plan, and not to mention the problem you are solving. 
3. Customers:Customers are really into knowing how your software can fix their specific problems and make their businesses run smoother. So when you pitch 'em, don't just focus on all the techy stuff or jargon. Instead, make it about how their lives will get easier and better with your product.

Use language they'll understand and relate to, and give them real-life examples or case studies of how other businesses just like theirs have benefited from using your solution. That way, they'll see how your software could work for them too.

And remember, different people have different priorities and interests. By tailoring your pitch to each stakeholder, you'll be able to show them how your software project is the perfect fit for their needs. This way, you'll have a better chance of getting their buy-in, support, and investment.
EXAMPLES:
A recent report by Gartner says the global software market will top $503 billion by 2025, growing at a steady 7.7% each year.

An article in IEEE Software just came out talking about how to build software systems that can handle lots of users and keep everything running smoothly.

A new study from Forrester found that almost nine out of ten customers are more likely to buy something if they've seen a good review first.

   - How do you address technical feasibility in your pitch? What details should you include to assure stakeholders of your project's technical viability?
